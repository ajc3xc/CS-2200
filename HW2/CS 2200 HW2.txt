HW #2 1.14a


Suppose for language B, there is a DFA M


Then Let M’ be the DFA swapping accept and non-accept states with M.


If M’ accepts a string S, then if it runs the string it will accept it.


However, because M and M’ are swapped, if x is run on M it won’t accept.


Thus if x is accepted by M’, it won’t be accepted by M.


Likewise if there’s a different string y accepted by M, it won’t be by M’.


So if x is in B, then x is not it B’


So M’ accepts the unaccepted strings of M


Therefore, M’ recognizes the languages complimenting B


Since M recognizes a regular language B, there is a DFA M’ that recognizes the compliment language of B that’s also regular.


Thus, the language classes are closed under complement.
